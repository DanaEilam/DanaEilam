# Nice to meet you! My name is Dana 🙋🏻‍♀️
I'm a recent B.Sc. graduate in the fields of Computer Science and Economics at Tel Aviv University, creative with sharp and critical thinking, a great team player, full of enthusiasm and extensive varied knowledge, and lots of passion for the world of design and games. 💻🎮

Would happily share some of my projects and ideas here, hopefully you'll be enlightened! 👩🏻‍💻
